## Reflectance

Reflectance is a component of the response of the electronic structure of the material 
to the electromagnetic field of light, and is in general a function of the frequency, 
or wavelength, of the light, its polarization, and the angle of incidence.

## Cauchy's equation: 
- λ = wavelength
- n = refractive index
- $n(λ) = A/λ^0 + B/λ^2 + C / λ^4 + ...$

Refractive Index:

A, B, C, etc., are coefficients that can be determined for a material by fitting the equation 
to measured refractive indices at known wavelengths. The coefficients are usually quoted for 
λ as the vacuum wavelength in micrometres.

Usually, it is sufficient to use a two-term form of the equation:
 
$n(λ) = A + \frac{B}{λ^2}$
 

## Schlick's approximation

is a formula for approximating the contribution of the Fresnel factor in the specular reflection of light from a non-conducting interface (surface) between two media. According to Schlick’s model, the specular reflection coefficient R can be approximated by:

$R(\theta )=R_{0}+(1-R_{0})(1-\cos \theta )^{5}$

with 

$R_0 = \left(\frac{n_1 - n_2}{n_1 + n_2}\right)^5$
